# About-me-
//Hi my name is Pedro Augusto Borges Assis
I'm 20 years old and I live in Brazil, I study computer science at the federal university of Jata√≠.
I have a dream to work as a developer / programmer and through this platform I will leave projects that define my skills and knowledge.
I'm not afraid to make mistakes, because my desire is to learn and be better.
I will always be open to suggestions and learning, so I make available my professional email to contact.

Therefore, in this profile will be available all my projects / codes- algorithms to serve as a sample.
